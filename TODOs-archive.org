* System architecture document
** DONE Drafting PRJ1-SAD1-v1.0
CLOSED: [2024-02-11 Sun 10:50]
ADDED: [2024-01-24 Wed]
+ Decompose the system into subsystems.
+ Describe also the build process, interaction with the software distributor,
  and dependencies.
+ Don't propose solutions/libraries for implementing the subsystems yet,
  this is the role of the design document.
+ Must include a matrix dispatching the requirements to subsystems.
+ See 'embedded database' for the database subsystem.
+ Provide justification for the architecture choice, in particular why
  a web app is not made.

* System requirements document
*** DONE Move the libs and module graph here
CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 14:04]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]
We have a diagram in the images for the SDD, move it here.
Explain the difference between libs and modules.

*** DONE Specify the config_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:24]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

*** DONE Specify the time_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:24]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

* External timesheet format
** DONE v1.1
CLOSED: [2024-11-03 Sun 12:11]
ADDED: [2024-10-30 Wed]
Additions:
+ In which order do the entries appear? Probably by ascending start date.
  + OK IRS1-BDY-090 added
+ The entry start dates are between the period start date and period stop date.
  + OK IRS1-BDY-100 added
+ Add the DB version to the export file header.
  + IRS1-HED-075, IRS1-HED-085 added
  + IRS1-HED-150 modified.
+ Example of compliant file modified.
** DONE Update program version format
CLOSED: [2025-05-05 Mon 19:21]
ADDED: [2025-05-05 Mon]
We decided on a format ~0.8~ which has no fixed size. We need
to update IRS1-HED-080 and IRS1-HED-140, and the example at the end.

** DONE Make dates timezone unambiguous.
CLOSED: [2025-05-05 Mon 19:51]
ADDED: [2025-05-05 Mon]
Use full date with time zone information just as in the logger
for export date, export start date and export stop date.
+ We decided to keep the timezone header line, as it gives more
  data than just parsing the dates in the header: it gives information
  about which timezone the export period is meant to be expressed in.
  In particular, giving only the dates could be perplexing if there
  is DST changes.

* Test plan: PRJ1-TST1
** DONE Describe the tests for the version module
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:24]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

** DONE Describe the tests for the config_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:24]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

** DONE Describe the tests for the time_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:24]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

* Repository documentation
** DONE Add a project timeline
CLOSED: [2024-01-23 Tue 19:59]
Add to the README a project timeline with the dates of release of the
documents and software.

* Doxygen documentation
** DONE Add libs and modules to the documentation
CLOSED: [2024-11-22 Fri 20:20]
ADDED: [2024-11-19 Tue]
The libs and modules were extracted from ~src/~, we need to add
them back to the documentation.

** DONE The github doxygen pages do not show anything on the index
CLOSED: [2024-11-22 Fri 20:41]
ADDED: [2024-11-22 Fri]
The deployment is successful and pages are there, but the index.html
page is completely empty with no links to anything.
- [2024-11-22 Fri] Fixed by bumping the doxygen version in the github action
  to use the same one as locally: 1.12.0

* CI
*** DONE Put the basic CI in place
CLOSED: [2024-12-28 Sat 18:48]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
Check the build only, at first.
+ We need to use a gentoo image, as per the documentation.
  We probably want ~amd64-nomultilib-openrc~.
+ See how we did it for puzzle_utils.
  We had a Dockerfile for downloading the dependencies (it was alpine).
+ See https://github.com/rapenne-s/build-gentoo-packages-for-me/blob/main/Dockerfile
+ We encounter a nginx error on our Drone CI related to ~413 Request Entity Too Large~
  this is likely fixed by setting ~client_max_body_size 0;~ somewhere in the nginx
  configuration.
- OK we are testing the build.

*** DONE Test that all the latex documentation builds
CLOSED: [2024-12-29 Sun 11:55]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
Check the latex documentation build.
+ It is pretty heavy to put a latex installation on a VM for automated building
  though.
+ See this docker: https://hub.docker.com/r/texlive/texlive/tags

*** DONE Add a test coverage report
CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 17:20]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]
Use lcov or gcov and upload the report to something publicly browsable which
gives which parts of the source are covered.

*** DONE Use a dockerhub account to avoid the image pull limits
CLOSED: [2025-03-29 Sat 18:12]
ADDED: [2025-03-23 Sun]
We can probably get a token and add it in the CI secrets.
- [2025-03-29 Sat] OK we have a docker username and token in the CI.

*** DONE Add static code analysis to the CI
CLOSED: [2025-04-06 Sun 13:32]
ADDED: [2025-03-28 Fri]
Run a cppcheck on the whole codebase as part of the CI.

*** DONE Add a check for unused includes
CLOSED: [2025-04-06 Sun 13:32]
ADDED: [2025-04-05 Sat]
See include-what-you-use
- [2025-04-06 Sun] Fixed all includes and added to CI.

*** DONE Add IWYU back into the CI
CLOSED: [2025-04-12 Sat 16:11]
ADDED: [2025-04-06 Sun]
It would be nice to have IWYU in the CI.
But we cannot compile llvm gentoo package on the CI server. It breaks the server.
Use a binary version or another linux image entirely for this (eg. alpine).
+ Maybe ~emerge --usepkgonly~.
- [2025-04-12 Sat] Added back in.

*** DONE Deploy the unit tests coverage to somewhere accessible online
CLOSED: [2025-04-13 Sun 14:50]
ADDED: <2025-04-06 Sun>
We would like to avoid relying on coveralls. Maybe copy the lcov report on
github pages directly.
+ We can try pushing manually to the github pages (which is the gh-pages branch
  of the repo). Maybe we can setup a token to allow the Drone CI to push to this
  branch?
+ We have to deploy both the doxygen documentation and the lcov report side by
  side. Simply push them to two separate folders seems like it would work.
  See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/18935539/authenticate-with-github-using-a-token
  we can add the token in the remote address.
+ We can just pull the existing pages somewhere on the CI docker, copy the new docs into
  this folder, and commit+push the difference to the gh-pages branch.
+ We have created a github token for this: ~timesheeting_gh_pages~
+ Remember to manage the case where there is nothing to push maybe (no diff).

*** DONE Use binary gentoo packages as much as possible in the CI
CLOSED: [2025-04-09 Wed 21:09]
ADDED: [2025-04-06 Sun]
The binary packages were not as normalized when we started the project.
The CI server is weak, and we could benefit from quicker test loops.
The binary packages should reflect a sensible default, so we see no reason
not to use them in tests.
- [2025-04-09 Wed] We configured the CI to use binary packages whenever available.

*** DONE Add a check for memory leak when running the unit tests
CLOSED: [2025-05-02 Fri 09:18]
ADDED: [2025-04-20 Sun]
The unit tests are supposed to trigger every exception etc., so
it is a good place to check for memory leaks.
Simply run the tests with valgrind on top, and figure out how to
return a valgrind error if some memory was leaked.

* Software
** Bugs
*** DONE Fix date parsing
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 16:24]
ADDED: [2024-08-31 Sat]
In ~date.h~, constructor from string.
The date parsing we are doing is wrong. We hardcoded the current dst
in our location to make it work.
+ We could wait for gcc 14 to have the proper C++20 feature to do this.
+ We tried howard hinnant date, but encountered a compiling error
  abount uninitialized variables when using parse. This is probably
  related to musl.
- [2024-11-23 Sat] We waited for gcc14 and used the std::chrono::parse. It works.
  We have lost the ergonomic flexibility offered by the previous function
  though.

*** DONE Triggering the "export file already exists exception" leaks memory
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 12:01]
ADDED: [2024-11-02 Sat]
This is fixed by catching the exceptions in main. Uncaught exceptions led
to destructors not being called.

*** DONE Catch exceptions in main
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 12:00]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
Catch all exceptions in main and have them print their message to cerr.
- [2024-11-23 Sat] Catching every std::exception in main and printing what().

*** DONE We are using the wrong type for ncurses characters
CLOSED: [2024-11-24 Sun 10:31]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
https://linux.die.net/man/3/getch
getch returns an int and not a char. This does not currently generate
bugs per se, but this prevents us from catching the KEY_RESIZE.
- [2024-11-24 Sun] Changed the type from char to int throughout the input loops.
  We can now catch the KEY_RESIZE events.

*** DONE The date condition for entries is wrong
CLOSED: [2024-12-28 Sat 19:52]
ADDED: [2024-12-16 Mon]
Currently, the stopwatch allows the addition of entries where start = stop.
We want to avoid this case also because there is a risk of adding two entries by
double-tapping validate.
+ We can just change the ~CHECK~ condition at the table creation.
+ See also the feature about forbidding overlapping entries.
- [2024-12-24 Tue] We have confirmed that there is currently nothing in the DB with
  start >= stop. We have to migrate our DB manually.
- [2024-12-28 Sat] We have changed the condition to start > stop. We confirmed that
  no additions are made when the condition is not met. The change is applicable
  to the DB v2. We migrated our DB manually by replacing the entries table
  with the newer one.

*** DONE Possible string security problem in ncurses usage
CLOSED: [2024-12-29 Sun 11:03]
ADDED: [2024-12-28 Sat]
The compiler reports the following during build,

```
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp: In member function 'void ncurses_lib::BarNCurses::print(const std::string&) const':
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp:13:12: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
   13 |     wprintw(win, msg.c_str());
      |     ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp: In member function 'void ncurses_lib::BarNCurses::print_right(const std::string&) const':
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp:22:12: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
   22 |     wprintw(win, msg.c_str());
      |     ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp: In member function 'void ncurses_lib::BarNCurses::print_after_cursor(const std::string&)':
/drone/src/src/libs/ncurses_lib/ncurses_lib/bar_ncurses.cpp:32:12: warning: format not a string literal and no format arguments [-Wformat-security]
   32 |     wprintw(win, msg.c_str());
      |     ~~~~~~~^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
```

This could mean that we are susceptible to problems if the printed message
has reserved format characters?
Is there a security risk here?
+ When naming a project as ~Proj%sE~, it is displayed in the bar as
  ~Proj(null)E~. This is pretty bad.
+ We fixed it.

*** DONE Escape and keypad cannot be used simultaneously in ncurses
CLOSED: [2025-01-12 Sun 15:47]
ADDED: [2025-01-07 Tue]
The support for keypad we added conflicts with binding the escape key
in edit mode.
+ One quick fix would be to disable the keypad when entering edit mode,
  and re-enable it when leaving.
+ We initialized the status bar so that it does not interpret the keypad
  keys.

*** DONE Project report total does not update immediately when changing the period
CLOSED: [2025-03-15 Sat 15:22]
ADDED: [2025-01-12 Sun]
- [2025-03-15 Sat] Fixed by calling total_bar.refresh()
  just after updating the period selector.

*** DONE In stopwatch, the task name cell string goes further than the cell size
CLOSED: [2025-03-15 Sat 15:03]
ADDED: [2025-03-03 Mon]
This happens only when we shift the selection in the menu.
+ This is a bug which appears in all menus in fact.
- [2025-03-15 Sat] Fixed it by cropping the print string in the window's print
  method to the size of the column.

*** DONE Input buffer + suggestion on status bar writes past the screen
CLOSED: [2025-03-28 Fri 19:44]
ADDED: [2025-03-23 Sun]
If we input a very long string in the status bar input buffer,
the eventual suggestion added at the end will be written past the screen,
which makes the display glitch out.
- [2025-03-28 Fri] Added a condition on the print_after_cursor method of
  BarNCurses. We only print the message if it will fit in the bar.

*** DONE Status bar empties when resizing in normal mode
CLOSED: [2025-03-30 Sun 14:03]
ADDED: [2025-03-23 Sun]
Currently, in the normal mode of any screen, the status bar
empties completely when we resize the window. It only returns to
normal after one input loop. Fix it so the status bar stays displayed
through resizing.
- [2025-03-30 Sun] Added an update_status() method to UIComponent, it updates what is
  displayed on the status bar. It is called when resizing on the current screen.

*** DONE Switching menu while trying to conserve scrolling is wrong
CLOSED: [2025-03-28 Fri 19:18]
ADDED: [2025-03-27 Thu]
We observe a bug when in a long menu: scroll to the bottom and then
switch to another page with much fewer items. The scolling will not
reset and the menu will not be displayed correctly.
We observed the bug on the entries screen and on the weekly report screen.
+ One solution may be to reset the scrolling and cursor position when
  changing page. Or add a mechanism in the menu itself when changing the
  elements (although we need to keep the cursor where it is when renaming/
  adding/deleting). Maybe check if the cursor is on screen, and if not
  then scroll so that it is.
+ Bug was also found on the project report screen, when switching from
  a scrolled menu to the bottom to a very short menu, nothing is displayed
  and we cannot scroll back up.
+ The same problem may exist when displaying/hiding archived items
  in project/tasks and locations.
+ The problem might exist in the entries/task screen. We should reset
  the scrolling and cursor whenever we display the tasks for a new project.
- [2025-03-28 Fri] We added a check and correction of the scrolling position in the
  set_items() method of the MenuNCurses.
  We checked the behavior was fixed on the entries screen, the project report
  screen, and the weekly report screen.

*** DONE Do we leak memory when disconnected from the DB?
CLOSED: [2025-04-13 Sun 15:26]
ADDED: [2025-04-12 Sat]
We are trying to run PRAGMA optimize on quitting, but doesn't it interrupt the
cleanup somehow?
This problem was recently picked up by cppcheck also.
- [2025-04-13 Sun] We moved the ~PRAGMA optimize~ from the destructor to the
  constructor, as it is less risky to have it fail in the constructor.

*** DONE Remove dangerous singleton methods
CLOSED: [2025-05-21 Wed 22:07]
ADDED: [2025-05-01 Thu]
See the answer here: https://stackoverflow.com/a/1008289/10376845
We have many singletons without these methods removed, resulting in possible
misuse.
- [2025-05-21 Wed] Removed the copy and assignment functions for all singletons in
  the program.

*** DONE Manage excentric dates far in the past and future
CLOSED: [2025-05-19 Mon 20:50]
ADDED: [2025-05-01 Thu]
Currently we can instantiate dates which end up as underflow in the DB,
this is very bad. Add a condition for only representing dates between
1970 and ~2100.
Either throw an exception or clip dates. Be careful this must apply
to dates obtained by shifting existing dates.
+ The right solution is probably to define a min and max date in UNIX
  format. Then throw an exception when trying to convert dates to UNIX
  if it goes outside the valid range. We can define a range between
  1970 (timestamp 0) and 2100 for example.
+ In fact we can get away with a signed int64. Dates with negative
  UNIX timestamp are still valid.
  We have to add a guard for when the input overflows the integer though,
  like the user inputting a comically large year.
  + The large years get clipped since the parser only takes the first four
    digits into account.
- [2025-05-19 Mon] We fixed the problem by representing timestamps as int64_t
  throughout the program, instead of uint64_t. This is valid for the chrono
  library and for the DB. Dates between year 0 and 9999 should be completely
  valid now, which is good enough for our use case.

*** DONE When trying to rename in an empty entries register, exception is thrown
CLOSED: [2025-05-22 Thu 21:13]
ADDED: [2025-05-02 Fri]
It is not very elegant to close the program when the renaming binding
is pressed in an empty entry register.
+ When removing an entry from an empty register, it is also weird to ask
  for confirmation even though there is nothing.
+ Also modify the column class to have this behavior (instead of try/catch
  the MenuEmpty exception).
- [2025-05-22 Thu] Fixed the entries_table.h: rename and remove.
- For the project_task_screen:
  - rename: ok, we no longer rely on exception catching.
  - project_task_change: ok, fixed also.
  - remove: ok, fixed also.
  - active_toggle: ok
  - Additionally, we removed the reliance on the MenuEmpty exception,
    which was ugly design.

** DONE Draft the GUI
CLOSED: [2024-02-18 Sun 17:44]
Reach a point where every main UI screen is present. Individual dialogs will be
implemented later.
+ Main UI with tabs and toolbar.
+ About dialog
+ Tabs:
  + Daily entries
  + Hierarchy items
  + Project totals
  + Weekly report
  + Export tool
+ Status:
  + Stopwatch in use
  + Save done/in progress/failed

** DEAD Draft the Daily entries screen
CLOSED: [2024-07-21 Sun 18:51]
ADDED: [2024-02-28 Wed]
Implement the gtk objects for presenting the daily entries.
It is roughly a VBox containing:
+ Day:
  + Current selected day display,
  + Select next/prev
  + Click on selected day to open calendar dialog and switch.
+ The total time for the day
+ The scrollable list of entries with, on each line,
  + Project name, Task name, start time, duration
+ The entry addition interface below, with a stopwatch.

*** Table of entries
See this:
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/77035908/gtkmm-4-10-scrolled-window-set-adjustments-horizontal-vertical-not-aut
There is an example from the gtkmm team here:
https://github.com/GNOME/gtkmm/blob/master/demos/gtk-demo/example_listview_columnview.cc

We should use ColumnView instead of TreeView since
TreeView is deprecated.
See
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/76711050/how-to-create-a-treeview-like-ui-using-columnview-in-gtk4
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/73145916/how-do-i-use-gtk4s-columnview-to-replace-treeview-in-python

** DEAD Dealing with stopwatch state
CLOSED: [2024-07-21 Sun 18:51]
How do we deal with the stopwatch object?
It needs to live in a given tab, but its state is also displayed in the status
bar. How do we share a view-only object from the tab to the status bar?
+ Maybe create the stopwatch object in main, and pass a shared_pointer
  throughout the object tree towards the "Daily entries" tab and a const
  shared_pointer to the status bar?

** Testing
*** DONE Test the config_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:23]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

*** DONE Test the time_lib
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:23]
ADDED: [2024-12-29 Sun]

*** DEAD Replace the CodeCoverage cmake module with a script
CLOSED: [2025-05-04 Sun 20:20]
ADDED: [2025-05-04 Sun]
The CodeCoverage module is an unnecessary complication.
We can prepare a cmake target for tests and run lcov directly
from a shell script. This would allow us to add options to lcov,
which we cannot easily do with the cmake module.
+ In fact, CodeCoverage does a lot of useful things, it is not
  straightforward to remove it.
+ We can pass LCOV_ARGS to it to manage lcov errors.

*** DONE Add Date parsing test for years before 1970 and after 2038
CLOSED: [2025-05-20 Tue 21:50]
ADDED: [2025-05-19 Mon]
+ In time_lib:
  + Test for parsing dates from strings with years before 1970 and
    after 2038.
  + Make sure the UNIX timestamp retrieved is OK (eventually negative),
    and that displaying the date back works.
  + Test that years beyond 9999 get clipped by the string parsing.
  + Test that years with a minus sign do not work.
+ In db_lib:
  + Make sure we can store negative integers.
  + Make sure we can store positive integers past 32 bits in length
    (year 2038 bug).
- [2025-05-20 Tue] OK, all of these tests were added.

** Ergonomy
*** DONE Enforce a display order for hierarchy items
CLOSED: [2024-11-16 Sat 13:35]
ADDED: [2024-09-03 Tue]
For instance, the queries for the list of tasks return a different
order depending on active/archived. Enforce a consistent order between
both. The choice which would make the most sense is to enforce an
order by Id at the DB level.

*** DONE Mark archived hierarchy items in some way in their own screen
CLOSED: [2024-11-24 Sun 15:48]
ADDED: [2024-09-02 Mon]
+ This requires passing the active flag to the UI.
+ We can use string_with_face to do this.
  - [2024-11-24 Sun] In fact, no. menu items only have one property for items,
    which is selectable or not. We are using it to make inactive, bold,
    items in the reports, but this is not applicable for regular lines.
    We need to implement our own menu library to do this, which is
    a big endeavour.
  + An alternative would be to put archived items in parentheses for
    display.
    - [2024-11-24 Sun] OK we did that.

*** DONE Renaming task empties the project
CLOSED: [2024-12-24 Tue 17:30]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
WAIT for the custom menu implementation
Currently, when renaming a task in entrystaging, a cancellation will
empty the project cell. Make it so that it does nothing instead.
+ Location in the stopwatch does the same.
+ [2024-12-24 Tue] We have fixed the whole stopwatch ui, it now checks for
  an empty string before trying to do anything.

*** DONE Suggestion on substrings
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 08:55]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
The suggestion engine prefers matching "Northern Office" rather than
"Office". We need to prefer the shorter match.
- [2024-11-23 Sat] Changed the rapidfuzz metric to CachedTokenSortRatio,
  which gives better results on preferring a submatch.

*** DONE Reorganize the configuration file
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 09:20]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
Currently the configuration file has two big sections, we need to split
it to make it clearer.
- [2024-11-23 Sat] Subdivided the sections into db, time, log, keys

*** DONE Do not reach program termination when hitting an unassigned key
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 20:30]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
Currently when hitting an unassigned key, the program unwinds until termination.
Fix it so nothing is done instead.
+ We need to implement a quit key.
+ See what happens when a resizing of the terminal window is done.
  We may have to catch it and refresh.

*** DONE Resizing makes some parts of the screen disappear
CLOSED: [2024-11-24 Sun 13:57]
When resizing the TUI to a smaller size, then resizing it back to
its original size, the bottom part of the UI disappears and never
reappears.
+ Be careful to not perform heavy operations when resizing, because
  user may resize the application as a floating window.
  For instance it would probably be heavy to destroy and redraw the
  whole UI.
- [2024-11-24 Sun] Caught the SIGWINCH ourselves, to prevent ncurses from
  performing the automatic resizing. The TUI stays functional if the
  initial size is restored.

*** DONE Be flexible on the accepted input dates
CLOSED: [2024-11-25 Mon 21:56]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
Currently the inputted dates must be exactly in the format "23Nov2024 13:25:00".
Also accept "23Nov2024", "23Nov2024 13", "23Nov2024 13:25" and fill with
zeroes.
- [2024-11-25 Mon] OK, we implemented the four variants of date format. It seems
  to work great.

*** DONE Log the export duration
CLOSED: [2024-11-26 Tue 20:27]
ADDED: [2024-11-25 Mon]
It would be useful to log the time it takes to export the timesheet.
- [2024-11-26 Tue] OK added a tick/tock around the export.

*** DONE Toggle archive visibility resets the screen
CLOSED: [2025-02-22 Sat 14:27]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
WAIT for the custom menu implementation
Currently, toggling archive visibility resets the whole screen.
Make it so the selection stays in place.
- [2024-11-23 Sat] This is quite hard to do because the whole menu is getting
  replaced every time. We would have to add the feature on the menu to
  save the current selection and restore it if possible.
  This is especially difficult when going from the full view to the
  active-only view, if the selection was on an archived item.
  We would have to track the alphabetical order.
- [2025-02-22 Sat] Solved by the custom menu implementation.

*** DONE Do NOTHING when hitting unbound keys
CLOSED: [2025-03-16 Sun 10:00]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
Currently the program shifts the selection when an
unbound key is inputted. Change this behavior to doing nothing.
+ This could be solved by staying within the current input loop
  whenever an unbound key is inputted. However this does not solve
  the problem of hitting keys which are bound elsewhere.
+ You can have every level of the input querying chain remember
  where its focus is.
+ The problem of switching focus is present in:
  + FIXED. Entries screen (between registry and stopwatch)
  + FIXED. Project Task screen, between projects and tasks
  + FIXED. Project report, between report and period selector
- [2025-03-16 Sun] We solved it by making screens remember their focus.
  It also solves the problem of keeping focus when changing back and forth
  between screens.

*** DONE Skip refresh when hitting an unbound key
CLOSED: [2025-03-22 Sat 20:25]
ADDED: [2025-03-16 Sun]
The display refreshes (visible blinking) when we hit an unbound key.
We should do nothing at all instead.
- [2025-03-17 Mon] Handled the project/task screen in an acceptable fashion.
  We filter for keys which we know will be used in the UI above,
  and only pass these. There are still unnecessary updates
  in the case of hitting direction keys at extremities
  (borders and status bar). We can remove the up/down by getting
  a return code from the menu "select_up_item" method.
- [2025-03-17 Mon] Removed all useless input-related refreshes
  in the project/task screen by making the menu return a status
  code for whether the selection has actually changed.
- [2025-03-22 Sat] Removed most of the useless refreshes from all screens.

*** DONE Handle resizing
CLOSED: [2025-02-22 Sat 14:29]
ADDED: [2024-11-24 Sun]
WAIT for the custom menu implementation
Handle the dynamic resizing of the TUI.
+ Make use of the full available terminal size.
+ NOK Ensure a minimum size is available, like xx lines per 80 columns.
  If it is not reached then stop the UI until it becomes big enough.
- [2025-02-22 Sat] Solved by the custom menu implementation.

*** DONE Be able to change the currently selected day from the stopwatch
CLOSED: [2025-03-23 Sun 09:58]
ADDED: [2024-11-26 Tue]
- [2025-03-23 Sun] OK, implemented.

*** DONE While in the weekly report, do not reset the cursor position when changing the duration display format
CLOSED: [2025-02-22 Sat 14:30]
ADDED: [2024-12-08 Sun]
Currently the cursor goes back to the top of the screen when the duration
display format is changed. This is annoying because sometimes we would like
to see the duration for the currently selected item in multiple formats.
- [2025-02-22 Sat] Solved by the custom menu implementation.

*** DONE What happens if we resize the terminal while in edit mode?
CLOSED: [2025-03-24 Mon 20:39]
ADDED: [2025-02-21 Fri]
I don't think we account for this case.
- The display currently glitches out when resizing in edit mode. It goes back
  to normal when exiting.
- The resize characters get added to the input buffer, which is wrong.
- When the input buffer is larger than the window, what do we do?
  The sane thing to do would be to exit the edit mode when resizing
  happens in fact.
- [2025-03-24 Mon] Fixed the issue by quitting edit mode when resizing.

*** DONE Display archived items in italics
CLOSED: [2025-02-22 Sat 16:12]
ADDED: [2025-02-22 Sat]
We need to add the italics face to the menu items.
Display the active items in normal face, and the archived items in italics face.
- [2025-02-22 Sat] Implemented.

*** DONE Stay in stopwatch or register when resizing from the entries screen.
CLOSED: [2025-03-16 Sun 10:03]
ADDED: [2025-02-28 Fri]
Currently, when the UI is on the entry screen and we resize, the focus shifts to the register
and does not stay in the stopwatch.
- [2025-03-16 Sun] Solved by making each screen remember their focus across
  input loops.

*** DONE Parse hh:mm using the currently selected register day
CLOSED: [2025-03-23 Sun 11:41]
ADDED: [2025-02-28 Fri]
Use the currently selected register day to parse a date string given as just
"hh", "hh:mm", "hh:mm:ss".
+ Add a Date method which uses a current day and the string.
  First try to parse the string without the day, if it fails
  then add the day in, and it it still fails then fail.
+ Perhaps pass a reference to the day selector to the stopwatch
  in order to do this.
- [2025-03-23 Sun] Implemented this. Seems to work well.

*** DONE Do not update the stopwatch start date when commit fails
CLOSED: [2025-03-22 Sat 20:26]
ADDED: [2025-03-05 Wed]
Currently, when a stopwatch commit is rejected, the start date is updated. Do
nothing instead.
- [2025-03-22 Sat] Took care of it when removing useless refreshes.

*** DONE Set the stopwatch start date to the previous end date on successful commit
CLOSED: [2025-03-22 Sat 20:37]
ADDED: [2025-03-16 Sun]
This is useful when entering dates manually, we only have to type
them once in the sequence.
- [2025-03-22 Sat] After committing the stopwatch entry, we query it
  from the DB and use the last end date as the new start date.

*** DONE Improve the suggestion engine
CLOSED: [2025-04-25 Fri 14:48]
ADDED: [2025-04-06 Sun]
For instance, we want to match:
  + exact prefix strings first, then
  + the first match of an exact substring,
  + then fuzzy.
Look online to see if there are libraries to do this.

*** DONE Parse hh:mm in the entries register
CLOSED: [2025-05-24 Sat 14:30]
ADDED: [2025-04-06 Sun]
When "renaming" a date in the entries register, use the currently selected day
to parse hh:mm dates, like what is done in the stopwatch.
- [2025-05-24 Sat] OK implemented.

*** DONE Lock the committing of entries from entry staging to the current day
CLOSED: [2025-05-24 Sat 19:18]
ADDED: [2025-05-02 Fri]
Only allow the committing of entries from the stopwatch to the currently
selected day in the entries register. This is locked by start date only.
+ We can add a method in ~Day~: contains_date to check whether the
  date is within the Day.
- [2025-05-24 Sat] Implemented.

*** DONE Lock the editing of entry start date to currently selected day
CLOSED: [2025-05-24 Sat 21:02]
ADDED: [2025-05-02 Fri]
Only allow setting a start date which is on the currently selected day
in the entry register.
+ The issue is, how do we modify the day on which an entry was inputted?
Just force to re-input could be a solution, since the entry would go off
the screen when editing anyway.
- [2025-05-24 Sat] Implemented the rule of forbidding moving the start date
  to another day.

** Refactoring
*** DONE Fix CMakeLists includes
CLOSED: [2024-11-30 Sat 14:10]
ADDED: [2024-11-30 Sat]
We have put ~target_include_directories~ everywhere. This includes everything
in everything no? Fix it.
- [2024-11-30 Sat] OK we divided the libs and modules more strongly. We cannot
  import something by accident now without it being explicit in the CMakeLists.

*** DONE Make constructors explicit
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 17:02]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
Through ignorance on our part, we have neglected to set constructors to explicit
by default. Fix it.

*** DONE Make sure the types are coherent
CLOSED: [2024-11-28 Thu 21:21]
ADDED: [2024-09-14 Sat]
For instance, sqlite uses the type sqlite3_int64, we use uint64_t,
should we switch?

+ https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/int64.html This says that sqlite3_int64
  stores a SIGNED 64bit integer. Thus, we really should not use uint64_t.
+ Create an integer typedef in the db_lib.
+ The ROWID in sqlite3 goes from 1 up to 2**63-1, so uint64_t makes sense,
  kind of. We will have no problem getting a rowid from sqlite, but may
  have problem when binding numbers to a statement. Add an exception in
  the binding code? Can't we use a sqlite3_int64?
- [2024-11-28 Thu] Added a DBInt type which is a sqlite3_int64. The RowId is
  also a DBInt, and the Id for hierarchy items is a RowId. In this fashion,
  the types are coherent.

*** DONE Extract library modules
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 17:02]
ADDED: [2024-09-22 Sun]
Extract generic library modules from the existing codebase, to import them
more easily and test them separately. Only extract the parts which are generic.
+ sqlite lib
+ ncurses lib
+ date management objects? (day, week, date, date_range, duration, timezone)

*** DONE Create namespaces for the libs and different parts of the program
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 17:02]
ADDED: [2024-09-22 Sun]
Currently everything is in the global namespace, which is bad practice.

*** DONE Separate the key for committing an entry from entrystaging from the validation key in edit mode
CLOSED: [2024-12-08 Sun 14:01]
ADDED: [2024-11-28 Thu]
Currently the key for committing an entry, and the code for validating in edit
mode are the same. This should not be the case. Create a separate key for
committing entries.
- [2024-12-08 Sun] OK, added a dedicated key for committing entries.

*** DONE Create config file subsection in keys
CLOSED: [2024-12-08 Sun 15:05]
ADDED: [2024-11-28 Thu]
The ~keys~ section of the config file is too big.
+ Create subsections for:
  + Navigation
  + Actions
  + Edit mode: cancel and select_suggestion and validate (needs to be separated
    because we can bind keys twice).
+ Also represent these sections internally.
- [2024-12-08 Sun] OK, modified both the config file and the internal representation
  for the bindings.

*** DONE Extract a generic library for the config file
CLOSED: [2024-11-30 Sat 19:54]
ADDED: [2024-10-13 Sun]
There is a generic part to the config file module.
+ Searching for the default location.
+ Expanding tilde.

This will allow us to add logs to the config module which will arise
out of this, without coupling it to the library.

*** DEAD Refactor MenuNCurses
CLOSED: [2024-11-25 Mon 21:59]
ADDED: <2024-09-01 Sun>
We can include the status bar display and basic input_loop navigation directly
in the MenuNCurses class.
Add the border highlighting there also.
- [2024-11-25 Mon] We will replace it with a custom menu implementation.

*** DONE Implement a custom ncurses menu
CLOSED: [2025-02-22 Sat 14:31]
ADDED: [2024-11-24 Sun]
Objective: Recreate a menu library for ncurses replacing the one
           provided in ncurses.
Motivation: The ncurses menu library is missing these features which
we need:
+ Dynamic resizing, and setting widths and ratios in multiple
  column menus.
+ Manage the appearance of items (highlight, color, bold, etc.)

Currently, using the ncurses menu library, we cannot put highlight
and colors on items. Also, we have to destroy and recreate the whole
menu when we could just redraw some things.
+ See whether someone already did this in c++
+ Develop on a separate branch, as it is a large task.
+ We can store "MenuItems" which have a string content, a short string
  content, and appearance attributes.
+ Interface with the existing window class.
+ Menu has to include multi-column. A custom menu is necessary to make
  columns with variable width.
+ Prepare for dynamic resizing.
- [2025-02-22 Sat] Implemented.

*** DONE Decouple the ncurses_lib from log_lib
CLOSED: [2025-05-18 Sun 16:43]
ADDED: [2024-11-27 Wed]
It makes no sense to have ncurses_lib depend on any logging. It
makes the library less reusable.
+ The reason they are coupled is because of the input_loop timing.
+ We could add a window class in the tui module which defines
  an instrumented input_loop on top of the basic input_loop.
  We likely have to do the same with every window child class.
- The dependency was removed by removing the input loop timing.

*** DONE Put final attributes everywhere on classes and methods
CLOSED: [2025-04-06 Sun 14:12]
ADDED: [2025-04-05 Sat]
This is a safeguard to avoid unintended inheritance.

*** DONE Add a handle to the DB in Statement
CLOSED: [2025-04-21 Mon 14:39]
ADDED: [2025-04-20 Sun]
Two problems are solved by this:
+ The db_lib is used in a leaky way currently in statement_set.
+ The Statement must sometimes check for error codes in the DB,
  eg. for an out-of-memory error on sqlite3_column_text(),
  but currently does not have a handle to it.
Maybe solve this by tying the statements to the DB handle. We add
the statements to the DB handle. In this fashion the statements are
always destroyed before the DB and we can safely share a db pointer
for error checking in the statements.
+ Make a DBConnection object which only opens and destroys the db.
  The DBConnection is created as a shared ptr by DBHandle.
+ The DBConnection is shared to the DBHandle and Statements.
+ DBHandle returns full Statement with a prepare method,
  it shares the DBConnection to the Statement when creating it.
+ In this fashion, the DBConnection always exists as long as DBHandle
  or Statements exist, and it is cleaned up when they are destroyed.
- [2025-04-21 Mon] Implemented.

*** DONE Decouple exporter module from DB
CLOSED: [2025-05-05 Mon 14:36]
ADDED: [2025-05-05 Mon]
We can remove the exporter dependency on the DB module.
We can take a set/generator of core::ExportRow as input.
+ We have changed the interface of the module, and removed the DB module
  from the linking of the exporter module.

** Fixes
*** DONE Manage more projects and tasks than one page
CLOSED: [2024-07-28 Sun 10:35]
ADDED: [2024-07-27 Sat]
Currently the window goes blank if we add too many projects.
OK, we implemented this using menu, and ~set_menu_format~.

** Performance
*** DONE Export the CSV from the DB line by line instead of in-full
CLOSED: [2024-11-26 Tue 20:16]
ADDED: [2024-11-02 Sat]
Our goal is to reduce the memory footprint of the export operation.
We can do it very easily by having the DB function return
a std::generator<ExportRow> but we have to wait for GCC14.
- [2024-11-26 Tue] OK we changed the DB export object from a vector to
  a generator. We cannot measure any difference in runtime when
  exporting a small DB with ~50 entries, so no major error is present.

*** DONE Use a hash function to match key bindings dynamically
CLOSED: [2025-01-12 Sun 16:03]
ADDED: [2024-11-10 Sun]
Currently we are doing an else if table, which is suboptimal.
This should not matter very much of course, but it is
cleaner to use some kind of hash from dynamic key to an enum of keys,
and then match the enums in a switch statement.
- [2025-01-12 Sun] Implemented key to Actions maps for bindings. The if ladders are
  replaced with switch statements.

*** DONE Consider adding sanitization flags
CLOSED: [2025-05-18 Sun 17:13]
ADDED: [2025-05-17 Sat]
Flag like ~-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow~ could make the program safer?
Investigate.
- [2025-05-18 Sun] OK we added the ~-fsanitize=signed-integer-overflow~ sanitizer.
  It does not seem to change anything. Unit tests still pass.
+ See also ~-fsanitize=address~, requires a third party library,
  so we leave it out.
+ See ~-fsanitize=undefined~, creates a lot of memory leaks, not sure why.

*** DONE Enable parallel build
CLOSED: [2025-05-18 Sun 17:27]
ADDED: [2025-05-18 Sun]
Our build is currently pretty long, enable parallel building
(probably a cmake option).
+ This already works with ~make -j6~.
  + Base build performance for monothread on our machine is 1m30.
  + ~-j6~ performance is 24s.
We do not enable it in the CI because there are already many CI jobs
done in parallel.

** Features
*** DONE Rename tasks
CLOSED: [2024-07-28 Sun 15:52]
- <2024-07-28 Sun> Added the db interface for renaming tasks. Made renaming
  mostly generic in project_task_table.

*** DONE Add tasks
CLOSED: [2024-07-28 Sun 16:17]
- [2024-07-28 Sun] Implemented the adding of tasks in project_task_table.

*** DONE Add a status bar
CLOSED: [2024-07-29 Mon 22:34]
The status bar should display the name of the current project or task
with more characters.
It will be used to ask for confirmation for deletions, and display
error messages.

*** DONE Make project and task names UNIQUE
CLOSED: [2024-07-30 Tue 21:53]
Do not do anything to the DB in case it is rejected.
A conflict can happen when:
+ Adding a new project or task.
+ Renaming existing project or task.

*** DONE Status bar: message with continue on press any key.
CLOSED: [2024-07-31 Wed 19:50]
ADDED: [2024-07-30 Tue]
Add a status bar interface: error message with a continue on key
press, to let the user see the message before the program continues.

Display an error message in the status bar when the user tries
to violate uniqueness.

*** DONE Fix: Handle the case where we have zero projects when starting
CLOSED: [2024-07-31 Wed 20:47]
ADDED: [2024-07-30 Tue]
If we start with an empty DB, the interface just crashes.
This is probably related to the status bar display of the current
item in the input loop for ~project_task_table~.
+ Handled the empty task case by displaying an empty string.
+ The program still crashes when started with an empty DB.
  Maybe we can initialize the DB if it is empty?
  But if the user deletes the last project this would likely crash.
  + Ok we can now display completely empty project/tasks tables.

*** DONE Fix: the tasks must be unique per project only
CLOSED: [2024-08-01 Thu 13:02]
ADDED: [2024-08-01 Thu]
The tasks are currently set to be globally unique. This is wrong.
They must be unique per project.
+ Modify the DB table to enforce this rule.
+ OK, we modified the table, renaming and adding work as expected.

*** DONE Delete tasks
CLOSED: [2024-08-01 Thu 20:36]
Ask confirmation in the status bar.

*** DONE Delete projects
CLOSED: [2024-08-01 Thu 21:06]
Also delete all tasks.

*** DONE Fix: Deal with trying to add a task when no project exists.
CLOSED: [2024-08-02 Fri 19:34]
ADDED: [2024-08-01 Thu]
If we start with a completely empty table and we try to add
a task, the program currently crashes.
+ [2024-08-02 Fri] OK, caught the ColumnEmpty exception, we do nothing.

*** DONE Feature/Ergonomy: Highlight the currently selected column
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 10:43]
ADDED: [2024-07-31 Wed]
It is hard to know in which column we are on the project screen.
It is impossible when the columns are empty.
+ Perhaps draw a box around the currently selected UI component.
  Draw the box once we enter the input loop, and remove it once we move
  out of it.

*** DONE Put the Logger behind an interface class
CLOSED: [2024-08-02 Fri 20:23]
ADDED: [2024-08-02 Fri]
Currently the logger is added without defining its interface first.
Add the interface class.

*** DONE Use logger globally
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 10:11]
ADDED: [2024-08-02 Fri]
Find a way to initialize the logger and use it globally without
passing a handle around to every other object in the program.

*** DONE Initiate the doxygen documentation
CLOSED: [2024-08-03 Sat 17:39]
ADDED: [2024-08-01 Thu]
The goal is to write the documentation for all the important source
files (esp. interfaces). We need to be able to generate the
doxygen html pages locally.

*** DONE Deploy the doxygen pages to a github site.
CLOSED: [2024-08-03 Sat 17:56]
ADDED: [2024-08-01 Thu]
Deploy the doxygen pages using a github action.
See our past projects where we have done this.

*** DONE Create the DB table for entries.
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 10:11]
ADDED: [2024-08-01 Thu]
Create a DB table for the entries,
it should contain: id, taskid, start date, stop date, location.

*** DEAD Create panels for entries and projects screens
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 21:07]
ADDED: [2024-08-15 Thu]
+ See:https://tldp.org/HOWTO/NCURSES-Programming-HOWTO/panels.html
Example 15.
+ Putting screens inside of ncurses windows breaks our current abstractions.
  One way to circumvent this is to have a ncurses top-level UI, which
  redraws everytime we switch between screens.
  We could have the individual screen have methods to refresh and clear
  themselves.

*** DONE Make the logger class singleton grab an implementation of a logger
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 12:41]
ADDED: [2024-08-24 Sat]
Avoid having to turn every class using a logger into a template on the
logger type. Make the singleton return an implementation of logger directly.
We can change the logger type there.
Also remove the ~logger~ member attributes everywhere, an include should suffice.

*** DONE Create log levels
CLOSED: [2024-10-13 Sun 09:28]
ADDED: [2024-08-24 Sat]
Create log levels and a way to set which ones are active or not.
Perhaps use an enum to pass which ones should be active or not.

*** DONE Try adding an index to the start column in the entries table
CLOSED: [2024-08-24 Sat 21:07]
ADDED: [2024-08-24 Sat]
We often select entries based on their start date.
Try measuring the improvement.
We added an index, we could not see the difference in performance since
our DB was tiny.

*** DONE Use the status bar to query new names or renames
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 17:25]
ADDED: [2024-08-25 Sun]
Using the menu themselves is impractical, as the cells are too short.

*** DONE Crop/pad the ncurses menu items to some fixed length
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 17:59]
ADDED: [2024-08-25 Sun]
The full names must still be displayed in the status bar.
+ [2024-08-25 Sun] The cropping part now works, but the padding is not taken into
  account by ncurses when spacing the menu items.
+ We fixed the padding by creating the string manually.

*** DONE Menus: remove the selection marker
CLOSED: [2024-08-25 Sun 09:43]
ADDED: [2024-08-25 Sun]
The selection marker in ncurses menu is useless since the element is
already highlighted. It takes up space for nothing. Remove it.

*** DONE Avoid SQL injections
CLOSED: [2024-08-27 Tue 19:58]
ADDED: [2024-08-25 Sun]
Currently there is a possibility to do SQL injections when
renaming, adding objects etc.
This is not critical in our application but it should still be
avoided as it could potentially destroy the DB.
+ See parameterized queries etc.
 https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/bind_blob.html
+ https://stackoverflow.com/questions/75828153/how-can-i-make-sqlite-reuse-a-prepared-statement-like-a-query-plan-cache
+ We can tell sqlite that these statements are all "persistent" by using
  the corresponding flag in prepare_v3.
 https://www.sqlite.org/c3ref/c_prepare_normalize.html#sqlitepreparepersistent
- [2024-08-27 Tue] We converted every statement into a parameterized query.

*** DONE Shorten the date display in menus
CLOSED: [2024-08-27 Tue 21:23]
ADDED: [2024-08-26 Mon]
When displayed in the entries registry and in entrystaging, the dates
should only read as ~HH:MM~. Do no modify the input mechanism for now,
still accept full dates only.
This will make room for a "Location" column.

*** DONE Factoring: create an utility to simplify the management of SQL statements
CLOSED: [2024-09-28 Sat 15:34]
ADDED: [2024-08-26 Mon]
In db_sqlite.cpp, the functions are quite long, and we juggle with many
statements. Create a statement object for preparing, stepping, finalizing
the statements automatically. Hold these statements in a container.

*** DONE Make the DB a singleton
CLOSED: [2024-09-14 Sat 15:20]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
We can do it in the same fashion as logger. A top file selects the db
implementation.
This will avoid making the UI classes templates.

*** DONE Make the status bar a singleton
CLOSED: [2024-09-14 Sat 15:20]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
We have a single status bar for the whole program. It makes sense
to share it with a singleton mechanism instead of passing a handle
down the full hierarchy of ui elements.

*** DONE Add a total bar to the project totals report
CLOSED: [2024-09-01 Sun 13:55]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
Add a total of totals over the same date range on the project totals report
screen.

*** DONE Implement the ability to archive/restore projects, tasks and locations
CLOSED: [2024-09-04 Wed 19:45]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
Add the specified archival capabilities projects, tasks and locations.
This only affects which items are displayed in the project/task screen,
and which items can be selected in the stopwatch.
Maybe implement a constraint in the DB that entrystaging cannot contain
an archived task or location at all.
We choose to retain the ability to edit a project or task in the
entries registry even if it is archived.
This can be implemented with a flag in the DB, pay attention to the consistency:
an archived project must also archive all of its tasks. A given project
can have some tasks archived and some not.
Implement a show/hide archived items in every Column, and the ability
to restore/archive there.
+ [2024-09-03 Tue] In fact, we only need to set an archived flag on a project
  to not show it on the hierarchy items and not be able to select it
  in entrystaging. Then if we unarchive it, the tasks automatically
  come back online, and archived tasks stay archived.
+ Check that, when we enter a project in entrystaging, the first task
  which is automatically proposed is not an archived one.

*** DONE Implement the weekly report
CLOSED: [2024-09-21 Sat 21:04]
ADDED: [2024-09-04 Wed]
+ List of SQLite statements to get all of the information:
  + Total for the whole week with query_entries_duration()
  + Total per day with repeated calls to query_entries_duration()
  + Total per day/week and per project with report_project_totals()
  + TODO: Total per task for a given day, return the tasks as rows
    in the statement.
+ UI elements:
  + A week selector (like the day selector in the entries table)
  + A total bar with the weekly total?
  + A big menu grid with the following columns: task, mon, tue, wed,
    thu, fri, sat, sun, total
    It includes the column headers.
    + The tasks are grouped by project
    + The total per project and per day is also displayed.
    + The last line gives the daily totals.
    + Blanks should be displayed instead of zeros.
  + The status bar displays the full string for the hovered element.
+ Create a report struct with sub-struct for every element in the table.
  Use this struct to interface with the DB. The DB returns the full
  report struct instead of little pieces.

*** DONE Check the day selector around DST changes
CLOSED: [2024-09-05 Thu 19:59]
ADDED: [2024-09-05 Thu]
We change the selected day by adding or subtracting one day from the
date. Are we sure it does the correct thing around a DST change?
+ We added a log printing the selected date range. The selected days
  were indeed off by one hour around DST changes.
+ We fixed it by getting the UTC time point + 1 day, converting
  to zoned time and rounding to nearest day whenever we shift
  the dates in the range selected.

*** DONE Ergonomy: Add the day of the week on the current day display in entries
CLOSED: [2024-09-22 Sun 18:19]
ADDED: [2024-09-07 Sat]
Add the display for the day of the week (eg. ~Mon~) on the entries screen.

*** DONE Make MenuNCurses have variable item width
CLOSED: [2024-09-08 Sun 11:11]
ADDED: [2024-09-07 Sat]
Currently the width of items inside a menu is hard coded. Make it depend
on the number of columns requested on construction.

*** DONE Adjust the width of ncurses columns
CLOSED: [2024-09-08 Sun 11:11]
ADDED: [2024-09-08 Sun]
Currently the columns have a set width which is too short. Make them occupy
the screen width.

*** DEAD Center the items display in menus
CLOSED: [2024-09-14 Sat 09:09]
ADDED: [2024-09-08 Sun]

*** DONE Refresh the reports whenever entries are updated
CLOSED: [2024-09-27 Fri 20:35]
ADDED: [2024-09-08 Sun]
Refresh the reports when entries are updated. The project totals screen
and weekly report are concerned.
Perhaps implement something where the need for update is stored somewhere,
and we actually update only when the user switches to the report.
+ We can have an UpdateManager which stores flags for each screen which
  tell whether a given screen is in need of update or not.
  When we refresh a screen, we check whether it needs to be updated also
  and do it.
  Each screen has a handle to the shared UpdateManager.
  For simplicity, we can set everything to need updates whenever
  the DB state is changed with respect to entries or hierarchy items.
+ The UpdateManager can centralize the management of updates:
  + It receives a call from UI screen saying that "entries have changed",
    or "hierarchy items have changed", and then it sets flags on the UIComponents
    to signal a need to update.
    The UIComponent have a generic refresh which calls the update if it is
    needed and set their flag back to zero.
    Both can be instanciated separately and then "connected" later? See how we
    both have how the UIComponents signal their changes and the UpdateManager
    set flags in the UIComponents.

*** DONE Refactor: Use a class for calendar days and weeks
CLOSED: [2024-09-22 Sun 16:13]
ADDED: [2024-09-13 Fri]
We often manipulate a calendar day (entries screen), and weeks (weekly report).
Convert it to Dates, DateRange etc. as needed.

*** DONE In the weekly report, highlight the project names
CLOSED: [2024-09-14 Sat 10:20]
ADDED: [2024-09-14 Sat]
The projects and tasks are all with the same typeface, this is confusing.
Make projects stand out more than tasks.
Maybe use the fact that ncurses menus allow items to be selectable or not
with a different face?
+ [2024-09-14 Sat] The project lines are now in bold thanks to being non-selectable
  in ncurses.

*** DONE Refactor db_sqlite
CLOSED: [2024-09-21 Sat 18:14]
ADDED: [2024-09-14 Sat]
Put the statements away in another class which prepares them and destroys them,
as well as bind things to them, step them, reset them.
+ We can get smart with the binding and stepping. These can be variadic somehow
  to bind or return variables of any types in order.
  Ideally we want to bind with: ~bind(statement, arg1, arg2, arg3, ...)~
  and retrieve results with: ~res1, res2, res3 = step(statement)~
+ It seems this is indeed possible:
  https://www.murrayc.com/permalink/2015/12/05/modern-c-variadic-template-parameters-and-tuples/
+ I think we can look for SQLITE_DONE to signal the end of stepping a statement
  to the user-code in db_sqlite. We can get results until this signal comes up.
+ Make sure to call reset at the END of processing a statement, not the
  beginning. We can automatically clean once we reach the end of the stepping
  in the method which gets the results.
+ We can factor further the db_sqlite methods which return a list of
  a generic item through a template. This takes the statement as input,
  and the type to return, and it is always the same thing in the method body.

*** DONE Implement the configuration file
CLOSED: [2024-10-16 Wed 20:29]
ADDED: [2024-09-22 Sun]
+ Do we really need a configuration file? Couldn't we just provide the
  configuration as CLI arguments with sensible defaults?
  + Yes we do need a file, otherwise the CLI becomes unusable.
Should be a file in a default location like XDG_CONFIG_etc.
Content is:
  + OK timezone setting (or system one if not set)
    + Have a dedicated timezone singleton which is initialized once,
      and called instead of ~std::chrono::current_zone()~.
      See ~std::chrono::tzdb::locate_zone~.
  + OK log level
  + OK db location
  + OK log location
+ Let's use a TOML format. The library tomlplusplus seems OK.
+ Have an internal singleton loading the configuration only once and
  then giving it on request using an internel representation.

*** DONE Github issue with doxygen deployment
CLOSED: [2024-10-16 Wed 20:25]
ADDED:[2024-09-27 Fri]

We are hitting this bug: https://github.com/JamesIves/github-pages-deploy-action/issues/1697
+ [2024-10-16 Wed] This solved itself.

*** DONE Implement the display of durations in days/hours/minutes
CLOSED: [2024-10-26 Sat 09:58]
ADDED: [2024-09-28 Sat]
+ It should be switchable on the fly with an automatic update.
+ The Duration class could query the current setting in a configuration struct
held somewhere.
+ Implement an internal configuration struct first. Maybe another singleton?
+ We may need a decoupling from Duration, to avoid coupling it with the
  configuration class? Maybe query the config in the total bar instead? or in a
  Duration decoupler class?
+ Maybe set it per duration item, not across the whole program. This simplifies
  the updates.
+ Wait a minute, how long is a day of work? We have to set this in a config file
  somewhere.
+ Currently the Duration are printed through a ~to_string~ method.
+ We can have a singleton DurationDisplay which holds:
  + The duration of a day of work (init from the config),
  + The current mode for display: day/hour/minute.
  + A method for producing a string from a duration with the current mode
    and config.

*** DONE Add a program version number.
CLOSED: [2024-10-27 Sun 11:40]
ADDED: [2024-10-27 Sun]

*** DONE Add a DB version number.
CLOSED: [2024-10-27 Sun 11:40]
ADDED: [2024-10-27 Sun]
This will be useful if we ever make a change to the DB layout,
and need to manage migrations.

*** DONE Add a CLI interface
CLOSED: [2024-11-01 Fri 14:57]
ADDED: [2024-10-26 Sat]
+ Print the version number. (this is a backup in case the log crashes
  completely).
+ Select the config file as argument.
+ Library to use: TCLAP (MIT license)
+ Decouple TCLAP from the program by wrapping it in our own library.
+ The ignore_rest flag is by default in TCLAP, it does not seem
  possible to remove it.

*** DONE Document the timesheet export format
CLOSED: [2024-10-27 Sun 10:35]
ADDED: [2024-10-26 Sat]

+ CSV file extension
+ UTF-8 encoding
+ (Human-) readable with the software less
+ Delimiter is comma
+ Column list:
  + Entry id
  + Project ID
  + Project name
  + Task id
  + Task name
  + Location id
  + Location name
  + Start date
  + Stop date
+ Header format: contiguous block of lines at the beginning, with # first
  character.
+ Header list:
  + Exported on: <Date>
  + Start of the exported period
  + Stop of the exported period
+ Header date format.
+ Entry dates format.
+ No field may be empty.

*** DONE Add CLI export tool
CLOSED: [2024-11-02 Sat 15:52]
ADDED: [2024-10-26 Sat]

*** DONE Consider adding the possibility of moving a task to another project.
CLOSED: [2024-11-03 Sun 10:19]
ADDED: [2024-10-31 Thu]
This is a real life need we encounter.
- [2024-11-03 Sun] OK implemented. No problem, the DB schema allows it perfectly.
  Error cases are also handled well out of the box.

*** DONE Implement the key bindings in the configuration
CLOSED: [2024-11-10 Sun 15:44]
ADDED: [2024-10-31 Thu]
+ Try avoiding a singleton pattern for this?
+ How do we deal with the keys which are already in the ncurses library?
  We may have to implement a key binding system there.
  We could have all interactive ncurses element take a shared pointer to
  a table of keys.

*** DONE Bind the cancel key to escape
CLOSED: [2024-11-10 Sun 15:48]
ADDED: [2024-11-09 Sat]
We must use a string sequence for representing escape.

*** DONE Limit string inputs to 80 columns
CLOSED: [2024-11-10 Sun 15:44]
ADDED: [2024-11-10 Sun]

*** DONE Implement fuzzy search suggestions
CLOSED: [2024-11-16 Sat 10:28]
ADDED: [2024-11-10 Sun]
When typing in the status bar, add the option to provide a set
of possible choices to choose from. These choices are displayed
next to the typed text in highlighted format.
+ One choice is displayed at a time. Based on a fuzzy search.
+ The choice may be selected by tabbing. Immediately selecting it.
+ See https://github.com/rapidfuzz/rapidfuzz-cpp, available in
  gentoo, MIT licensed. We probably want partial-token-set-ratio.
+ Places where we want suggestions:
  + Entries screen
    + OK Renaming entry project
    + OK Renaming entry task
    + OK Renaming entry location
  + Stopwatch
    + OK Setting the stopwatch project.
    + OK Setting the stopwatch task.
    + OK Setting the stopwatch location.

*** DONE Run pragma optimize on closing sqlite
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 17:16]
ADDED: [2024-09-01 Sun]
It seems recommended: https://www.sqlite.org/lang_analyze.html
- [2024-11-23 Sat] ADDED ~PRAGMA optimize;~ when closing the DB handle
  in db_lib.

*** DONE Use a date format with timezone in logs.
CLOSED: [2024-11-16 Sat 15:05]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
Currently the logs are ambiguous, they show the local time but without
more indication.

*** DONE Catch the fact that a configuration file does not exist
CLOSED: [2024-11-24 Sun 16:11]
ADDED: [2024-11-01 Fri]
We currently get a toml exception which is too cryptic for users.
+ [2024-11-24 Sun] OK we now throw our own exception. It gives a clearer message.
  It is thrown when providing an inexistent file with the -c flag in the CLI.

*** DONE Write the make install script
CLOSED: [2024-11-24 Sun 14:33]
ADDED: [2024-11-23 Sat]
We need the install script for our program.
+ This can probably be done in cmake directly.
+ Actions:
  + Put the binary at the appropriate place.
  + Put the config file in dotfiles.
- [2024-11-24 Sun] Wrote the installation instructions in CMakeLists.txt, the binary
  is deployed in `/bin/`, the default configuration file in `/etc/`.

*** DONE Abandon primary/alternative mapping of keys in config
CLOSED: [2025-01-15 Wed 21:46]
ADDED: [2025-01-14 Tue]
Use a list of strings for indicating keys for a given mapping in the config
file. Add everything to the map when loading. In this fashion we can have as
many bindings as we want.
- [2025-01-15 Wed] Implemented this solution.

*** DONE Protect against binding the same key twice to the same mode
CLOSED: [2025-01-16 Thu 20:13]
ADDED: [2024-11-28 Thu]
When loading the keys into BoundKeys, check that keys are not bound twice in the
same section. Edit mode and the other sections may mix however.
Stop with an exception if this is the case.
+ We have to check navigation+actions together, and edit_mode separately.
+ This takes care of itself if we build a hashmap for the related
  issue abount mapping keys to an enum, existing keys can be detected as they
  are added.
+ We need to include backspace in the map also somehow, since it is matched
  in the status_bar functions.
- [2025-01-16 Thu] Added an exception throw in the BindingMap class when
  we try to map an existing binding.

*** DEAD Implement a check of the DB when opening
CLOSED: [2024-11-23 Sat 17:10]
ADDED: [2024-11-16 Sat]
+ Check that all tables are indeed present.
  - [2024-11-23 Sat] It is in fact meaningless since we create the tables right
    when the DB opens anyway.
+ OK Check the version of the DB.

*** DONE Clean old log entries
CLOSED: [2025-01-29 Wed 21:21]
ADDED: [2024-10-26 Sat]
+ Launch it at startup.
Start from the top of the log file, parse the date into an internal UTC format,
compare it with startup time, any line which is older than target gets deleted,
we stop once we reach the first recent enough entry.

*** DONE Bind arrow keys to up/down/left/right
CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 17:06]
ADDED: [2024-11-09 Sat]
Use alternative bindings to bind arrow keys to navigation.
It does not seem we can escape a character to represent the arrow
key. We have to use a string to represent it.

*** DONE Implement a set of special keys available for bindings
CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 17:06]
ADDED: [2024-11-10 Sun]
Implement the following special keys:
+ ESCAPE
+ ENTER
+ SPACE
+ TAB
+ UP/RIGHT/DOWN/LEFT

*** DONE Implement the alternative key bindings
CLOSED: [2025-01-05 Sun 15:15]
ADDED: [2024-11-10 Sun]
Note these are optional. Only those which are present in the configuration
are loaded. The rest are kept to zero.

*** DONE Prevent overlapping entries
CLOSED: [2025-02-23 Sun 14:31]
ADDED: [2024-11-25 Mon]
Overlapping entries have no use-case, do they? Should we forbid
them at the DB level?
+ It could get annoying when manually entering entries. We would have to
  type dates to the second.
  + Not if we allow start(n) >= end(n-1)
+ This likely requires a table change, think about migration.
+ See this answer: https://stackoverflow.com/a/44347885/10376845
  we need to modify the condition, which does not suit us.
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/4023160/prevent-inserting-overlapping-date-ranges-using-a-sql-trigger
  Can we use BETWEEN? -> yes
  https://stackoverflow.com/questions/9581458/how-can-i-prevent-date-overlaps-in-sql
+ Check that there are no overlaps in our DB first.
+ Print an error in the status bar if the case is encountered.
+ The check must happen whenever we:
  + Add a new entry
  + Update the dates of existing entries.
- [2025-02-23 Sun] Implemented.

*** DONE Add individual tasks to the project report
CLOSED: [2025-02-23 Sun 10:17]
ADDED: [2025-01-24 Fri]
We often need the detailed view to see how much time we spent on a given
task over a particular period.
- [2025-02-23 Sun] added.
