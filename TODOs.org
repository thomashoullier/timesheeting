* System architecture document

** TODO Drafting PRJ1-SAD1-v1.0
ADDED: [2024-01-24 Wed]
+ Decompose the system into subsystems.
+ Describe also the build process, interaction with the software distributor,
  and dependencies.
+ Don't propose solutions/libraries for implementing the subsystems yet,
  this is the role of the design document.
+ Must include a matrix dispatching the requirements to subsystems.
+ See 'embedded database' for the database subsystem.
+ Provide justification for the architecture choice, in particular why
  a web app is not made.

* Subsystem requirements document
** PRJ1-SRS1
Details the requirements applicable to subsystems, as described in the SAD.

* System Design document
** PRJ1-SDD1
Proposes the implementations of the subsystems, along with a
justification/tradeoff.
+ Propose very abstract drawings for the UI screens.

* Repository documentation
** TODO Add a documentation tree
We need to synthesize the list of documentation available. Perhaps do it
directly in the project readme.
+ We can do a graphviz of all documentation and software. We can show every version
  and the "Applicable documents" links between them.

** DONE Add a project timeline
CLOSED: [2024-01-23 Tue 19:59]
Add to the README a project timeline with the dates of release of the
documents and software.
