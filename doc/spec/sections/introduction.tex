\section{Introduction}
Our need is as follows. We need a software to create, manage and report
personal timesheets. We named the corresponding project \emph{timesheeting}.

A timesheet is a table of hours worked on a particular task of a particular
project. We need to track this for managing personal time. The timesheets
are then exported for reporting the hours to external stakeholders, and
for interoperability with other tools.

The software \emph{titra} \cite{titra} fills this need rather well. However
we want to tailor a tool exactly to our requirements, this is what motivates
this project.

The present document starts by providing definitions, and then lists
the requirements.
