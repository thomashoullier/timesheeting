\section{System architecture diagram}
The proposed system is decomposed into the following subsystems. We distinguish
between the subsystems active while the user interacts with the software (online
subsystems), and the auxiliary susbsystems (offline subsystems). We outline
the function of each subsystem and provide a diagram for illustration.

The stakeholders are,
\begin{itemize}
\item the user,
\item the developer.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Online subsystems}
We decompose the software into subsystems.
The software comprises the following online subsystems,
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{\gls{GUI}} displays the \gls{UI} screens to the user. It
  allows the user to input information into the software and interact.
\item The \textbf{Core logic} handles the manipulation of timesheet data for
  presentation to the user. It decouples the GUI subsystem from the rest
  of the application.
\item The \textbf{Settings manager} loads the user configuration file, and
  propgates the settings to the application.
\item The \textbf{Exporter} is in charge of generating the export file
  for timesheet data.
\item The \textbf{\gls{DB} backend} interacts with the \gls{DB}. It decouples
  the database operation from the rest of the application.
\item The \textbf{Backup manager} creates and restores backup files for the
  current application state.
\item The \textbf{Logger} records the application logs.
\end{itemize}

\cref{fig:arch-diagram} illustrates the interaction between these
subsystems.

The data files involves in the operation of the software are,
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{User configuration file} allows the user to configure the
  application. This is a text file the user edits.
\item The \textbf{User state file} records some of the application states
  for ergonomy and interaction. It does not contain any critical data such
  as timesheet data.
\item The \textbf{Logs} record application events for debugging purposes.
\item The \textbf{Database} allows the application to store and retrieve
  critical data. It is persistent.
\item The \textbf{Export file} is a user-readable file generated on-demand
  from the timesheet data.
\item The \textbf{Backup} is an archive recording the critical application
  data, for saving the data elsewhere, or transfering between systems.
  It allows restoring the database.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Offline subsystems}
We outline the high-level build process.

The software comprises the following offline subsystems,
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{Versioning} system tracks the state of both the software
  source and documentation source.
\item The \textbf{Software distribution} system manages the release of
  software source to the user.
\item The \textbf{Build} system generates a binary from the software source.
\item The \textbf{Automated testing} comprises the tests that are run
  automatically for every software release. It is part of the \gls{CI} pipeline.
\item The \textbf{Manual testing} comprises the tests performed by the
  \textbf{Tester}, manually, for every software release. It is part of the
  tester pipeline.
\item The \textbf{Documentation generator} generates the documentation
  releases from the documentation source.
\item The \textbf{Documentation distribution} manages the release of
  documentation reports.
\item The \textbf{Signature system} authenticates the released source and
  released documentation as coming from the author.
\item The \textbf{Issue tracking} allows the \emph{user} to file bug reports.
\end{itemize}

\cref{fig:offline-diagram} illustrates the interaction between these subsystems.

There are three build pipelines in parallel,
\begin{itemize}
\item The \textbf{User} pipeline: the \emph{user} receives the \emph{released
    source}, and uses the \emph{build} system to generate a binary. The
    \emph{user} then uses the binary.
  \item The \textbf{\gls{CI}} pipeline: The software source for every version
    are automatically sent to a \gls{CI} system, where the source are built into
    a binary. Assuming the build was successful, automated tests are then run
    on the binary. The results are reported publicly in the software
    distribution system.
  \item The \textbf{Tester} pipeline: The software source is built by the tester
    using the build system. The binary is then tested against a set of manual
    cases.
\end{itemize}
