\section{System architecture diagram}
The proposed system is decomposed into the following subsystems. We distinguish
between the subsystems active while the user interacts with the software (online
subsystems), and the auxiliary susbsystems (offline subsystems).

The stakeholders are,
\begin{compactitem}
\item The user,
\item the user's system,
\item the developer.
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Online subsystems}
We decompose the software into subsystems.
The software comprises the following online subsystems,
\begin{compactitem}
\item GUI
\item Core logic
\item Settings manager
\item Backup manager
\item Exporter
\item DB backend
\item Logger
\end{compactitem}

\subsection{Offline subsystems}
We outline the high-level build process.

The software comprises the following offline subsystems,
\begin{compactitem}
\item Versioning system
\item Distribution system
\item Build system
\item Testing
\item Documentation generator
\item Documentation distributor
\item Bug report
\end{compactitem}
