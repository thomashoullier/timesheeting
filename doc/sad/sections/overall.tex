\section{Overall architecture} \label{sec:overall}
The proposed timesheeting software is a desktop linux application.
The software embeds a \gls{DB} for saving timesheet data and software
state. The software is configured through a user dotfile. It also includes
timesheet data export capabilities to an interoperable format. A logging system
to a file is included.

The software is distributed through source releases. The associated
documentation is distributed via a documentation distribution channel.
The software and documentation releases are signed. We propose
testing pipelines. The user can file bug reports to an issue
tracking system.
