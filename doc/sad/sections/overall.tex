\section{Overall architecture} \label{sec:overall}
The proposed timesheeting software is a desktop \gls{GUI} linux application.
The software embeds a \gls{DB} for saving timesheet data. It is
configured through a user dotfile. It includes a utility to make
a backup of the database. It also includes timesheet data export
capabilities to an interoperable format. A state file is used
for ergonomy. A logging system is proposed.

The software is distributed through source releases. The associated
documentation is distributed via a documentation distribution channel.
The software and documentation releases are signed. We propose
testing pipelines. The user can file bug reports to an issue
tracking system.
