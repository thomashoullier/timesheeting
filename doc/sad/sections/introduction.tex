\section{Introduction}
timesheeting is a software project for creating, managing and reporting
timesheet data. The present document is in answer to the project's user
specification document [AD1].

The document is organized as follows. We outline the overall architecture
briefly in \cref{sec:overall}. The system architecture is decomposed into
subsystems and presented in \cref{sec:system-diagram}. Finally,
the user requirements [AD1] are dispatched to the subsystems in
\cref{sec:req-dispatch}.
