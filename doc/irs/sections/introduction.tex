\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context}
We answer to the project requirement XXX for exporting timesheet data.
The format is meant to be interoperable, \textit{ie} it is meant to be
easily usable with a wide selection of external programs. The external
programs typically targetted are spreadsheet programs (\emph{Libreoffice Calc},
\emph{Gnumeric}), \gls{CLI} text programs (\emph{less}, \emph{vi}),
and Python libraries such as \emph{pandas}.

\subsection{Document structure}
The document is structured as follows,

\begin{itemize}
\item Definitions (header, body)
\item Requirements list
\item Example of compliant timesheet in external format.
\end{itemize}
