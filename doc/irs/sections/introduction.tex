\section{Introduction}
\subsection{Context}
In support of the project requirement R-DEX-010 [RD1], we provide a format
for timesheet data export to a file.

The format is meant to be interoperable, \textit{ie} it is meant to be
easily usable with a wide selection of external programs. The external
programs typically targetted are spreadsheet programs (\emph{Libreoffice Calc},
\emph{Gnumeric}), \gls{CLI} text programs (\emph{less}, \emph{vi}),
and Python libraries such as \emph{pandas}.

We prioritize ease of use and readability for the exported format over
compactness and efficiency.

\subsection{Document structure}
The document is structured as follows. First, definitions are given
(\cref{sec:definitions}), then the requirements for the exported file
are listed (\cref{sec:requirements}) and finally an example of a compliant
export file is given (\cref{sec:example}).
