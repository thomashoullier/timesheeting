\section{Implemented architecture}
The program is built from \emph{modules}. These modules are themselves supported
by \emph{libraries}. The modules implement behavior specific to the program
while the libraries abstract generic behaviors. The libraries may in theory be
reused in other programs. \cref{fig:arch_modules} is a diagram showing the
dependency between the different modules and libraries in the program. This
diagram also shows external dependencies, only for information. A brief
description of each module and library is given below.

\subsection{Libraries}
The following libraries are included in the program,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{config\textunderscore lib} loads a configuration file and reads fields
  from it.
\item \textbf{time\textunderscore lib} contains objects related to date and
  time, including durations, timezone management.
\item \textbf{log\textunderscore lib} provides logging capability of messages to
  a file.
\item \textbf{db\textunderscore lib} abstracts the interface to the \gls{DB}, it
  allows running statements for setting or querying data.
\item \textbf{ncurses\textunderscore lib} implements some objects on top
  of ncurses.
\item \textbf{suggestion} is a text suggestion engine.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modules}
The following modules are included in the program,
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{version} configures the version numbers for the program and the
  \gls{DB}.
\item \textbf{cli} creates the \gls{CLI} for the program.
\item \textbf{core} contains data objects specific to the program, to be
  manipulated across modules.
\item \textbf{db} is the \gls{DB} interface implementation.
\item \textbf{keys} manages the key bindings for the \gls{TUI}.
\item \textbf{tui} creates the \gls{TUI} for the program.
\item \textbf{exporter} allows the export of timesheet data to an external
  data format.
\end{itemize}
