\section{Modules testing}
\subsection{version}
The version module is tested using automated unit tests.

\paragraph{MT-VER-010 -- Program version number}
We get the current program version number as a \emph{string}.
We check that its format is compatible with the following \emph{regular
  expression}: \lstinline{[0123456789]+\.[0123456789]+(?:dev)?}.

\textit{Tests: } MR-VER-010 -- Program version number

\paragraph{MT-VER-020 -- DB version number}
We get the current DB version as an integer. We test it is greater than zero.

\textit{Tests: } MR-VER-020 -- DB version number

\subsection{config}
The following automated unit tests are used for the config module.
