\section{Introduction}
The test plan contains tests covering the requirements of the program
subsystems [AD2], as well as end-to-end verification of the program
behavior [AD1].

The test plan is divided into several sections, in correspondence to the
program level of abstraction.
\begin{itemize}
\item Automated unit testing of libraries,
\item automated unit testing of modules,
\item automated end-to-end testing,
\item manual QA test.
\end{itemize}

Our approach is to automate most of the testing, and only perform a manual
test on the \gls{TUI} level, which cannot be easily and fully tested
automatically. As such, the testing of graphical elements at the unit level
is not done, it is only done at the end-to-end level.
